# TimeRecorder
Easy app to record time for certain things. Specifically for me is to record how much time is spent on Uni subjects.

Try it yourself:
git clone https://github.com/SethSharp/TimeRecorder
npm i
Create a .env file in the root and add:
  LOCAL_DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/timeRecorder
  PORT=3000
Table name is up to you
node server.js
